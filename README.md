# alphaama A<3

alphaama is just a nostr fucking client dat:
- is a research in UI/UX on how a command line interface (cli) can merge with a graphical user interface (gui)
- tries to be fun and weird.
- let's you interact with nostr exposing the protocol instead of abstracting it.
- tries to be very minimalistic but extremely flexible.
- doesn't do it all yet, soonâ„¢.
- is not for everyone.
- keeps changing in breaking ways.
- probably has bugs and bad decisions.
- is a learning tool.
- is public domain, free and open-source.
- you can do whatever the fuck you want with it.
- is written in vanilla js, html and css.
